# Truefoundry
TrueFoundry assignment

The goal of this assignment is to create a small website using NestJS (https://nestjs.com/ ) in the backend and basic HTML CSS in the frontend. The website should allow anyone to authorize their github account and the code will create a sample repo with some files in their account.
The interface can be as simple as:
On clicking on Authorize Github, it will take me to my Github account where I can grant permissions to my account. We only need the permission to be able to create a repo in my account. This will require building a Github app (similar to Login with Facebook, Google - if you have worked with them earlier).
On clicking on the Create Repo button, it will create a repo in the userâ€™s account with some sample code.
